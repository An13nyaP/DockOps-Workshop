Certainly! Below is a `commands.md` file that provides examples for each of the advanced Docker concepts mentioned earlier:

---

# Docker Commands: Advanced Concepts

## 1. **Docker Compose**

### 1.1 **Starting Docker Compose**

Use `docker-compose up` to start services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will:
- Build images if necessary.
- Start the containers in the background.

To run it in the background (detached mode), use the `-d` flag:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 1.2 **Stopping Docker Compose**

To stop services:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will stop all running containers and remove any associated networks.

### 1.3 **Viewing Logs**

To view the logs of all services:

```bash
docker-compose logs
```

For a specific service, use:

```bash
docker-compose logs <service_name>
```

---

## 2. **Volumes in Docker**

### 2.1 **Create a Volume**

Create a volume named `my_volume`:

```bash
docker volume create my_volume
```

### 2.2 **Inspect a Volume**

To get information about a volume:

```bash
docker volume inspect my_volume
```

### 2.3 **Use Volumes in a Container**

To run a container with a mounted volume:

```bash
docker run -d -v my_volume:/data ubuntu
```

This will mount the `my_volume` to the `/data` directory inside the container.

### 2.4 **Remove a Volume**

To remove a volume:

```bash
docker volume rm my_volume
```

If the volume is in use, youâ€™ll need to stop the container using it first.

---

## 3. **Docker Networking**

### 3.1 **Create a Custom Network**

Create a custom bridge network:

```bash
docker network create --driver bridge my_network
```

### 3.2 **Run Containers on a Custom Network**

To run a container and attach it to a custom network:

```bash
docker run -d --network my_network --name container1 ubuntu
```

### 3.3 **List Networks**

To list all Docker networks:

```bash
docker network ls
```

### 3.4 **Inspect a Network**

To inspect a specific network:

```bash
docker network inspect my_network
```

This will give detailed information about the network, including connected containers.

### 3.5 **Connect a Container to a Network**

To connect a running container to a network:

```bash
docker network connect my_network container1
```

### 3.6 **Disconnect a Container from a Network**

To disconnect a running container from a network:

```bash
docker network disconnect my_network container1
```

---

## 4. **Docker Swarm and Clustering**

### 4.1 **Initialize Docker Swarm**

To initialize Docker Swarm:

```bash
docker swarm init
```

### 4.2 **Create a Service in Docker Swarm**

To create a service named `my_service` that uses the `nginx` image:

```bash
docker service create --name my_service nginx
```

### 4.3 **Scale a Service**

To scale the service to 3 replicas:

```bash
docker service scale my_service=3
```

### 4.4 **List Swarm Services**

To list all services in the swarm:

```bash
docker service ls
```

### 4.5 **Remove a Service**

To remove a service:

```bash
docker service rm my_service
```

---

## 5. **Docker Secrets Management**

### 5.1 **Create a Secret**

Create a secret called `my_secret` from a file:

```bash
echo "mysecret" | docker secret create my_secret -
```

### 5.2 **Create a Service Using Secrets**

To create a service using a secret:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    secrets:
      - my_secret

secrets:
  my_secret:
    external: true
```

### 5.3 **List Secrets**

To list all available secrets:

```bash
docker secret ls
```

### 5.4 **Inspect a Secret**

To inspect a specific secret:

```bash
docker secret inspect my_secret
```

---

## 6. **Dockerfile Advanced Usage**

### 6.1 **Build an Image from Dockerfile**

To build an image from a Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -t my_image:v1 .
```

This will build the Docker image with the tag `my_image:v1` using the Dockerfile in the current directory.

### 6.2 **Build Using Multi-Stage Dockerfile**

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:14 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install

# Final stage
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app /app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

To build this Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -t my_image:v2 .
```

### 6.3 **Ignore Files with .dockerignore**

Create a `.dockerignore` file to avoid adding unnecessary files to the image:

```bash
# .dockerignore
node_modules/
*.log
```

This will prevent files like `node_modules/` and `*.log` from being included in the image.

---

## 7. **Docker Image Layers and Caching**

### 7.1 **Build an Image with Caching**

To build an image using cached layers (if available):

```bash
docker build --no-cache -t my_image:v3 .
```

### 7.2 **Inspect Layers of an Image**

To inspect the layers of an image:

```bash
docker history my_image:v1
```

This will show the different layers created during the image build process.

---

## 8. **Security Best Practices in Docker**

### 8.1 **Run a Container as a Non-Root User**

To run a container as a non-root user (e.g., user ID 1000):

```bash
docker run -d --user 1000 ubuntu
```

### 8.2 **Scan an Image for Vulnerabilities**

To scan an image for vulnerabilities (using `docker scan`):

```bash
docker scan my_image:v1
```

### 8.3 **Limit Resources for a Container**

To limit the CPU and memory usage for a container:

```bash
docker run -d --memory="256m" --cpus="1.0" ubuntu
```
