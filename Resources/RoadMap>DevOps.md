  - **Azure** or **GCP**: If you prefer to focus on other clouds.

---

### **10. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- **What is IaC?**: Managing and provisioning servers via code.
- **Tools to Learn**:
  - **Terraform** (most popular for cross-cloud provisioning).
  - **CloudFormation** (for AWS users).
  
---

### **11. Monitoring and Logging**
- **Monitoring Tools**:
  - **Prometheus + Grafana** (Popular for metrics collection and visualization).
  - **Datadog** (Cloud-based monitoring service).
- **Logging Tools**:
  - **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana for log management).
  - **Fluentd** (another log collection and processing tool).

---

### **12. Networking & Security**
- **Basic Networking**: Learn about IPs, DNS, Load Balancers, VPNs, and Firewalls.
- **Security**: Basic security practices like encryption (SSL/TLS) and secrets management.
  - Tools: **Vault** by HashiCorp for managing secrets.

---

### **13. Microservices Architecture**
- **Microservices**: Learn to build scalable applications broken down into smaller services (each service runs in its own container).
  - Tools: **Docker + Kubernetes** for microservices management.

---

### **14. Final Skills & Certifications**
